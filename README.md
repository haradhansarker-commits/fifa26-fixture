# ⚽ FIFA World Cup 2026™ — Live Fixtures & Standings

**A fast, mobile-first web app for following the 2026 World Cup — real fixtures, live group standings, the full knockout bracket, and match detail, all pulled straight from FIFA's public data.**

No backend. No API key. No database. Just open it and watch the tournament unfold.

## ✨ What it does

| | |
|---|---|
| 🗓️ **Fixtures** | All 104 matches, grouped by day, with live scores, kickoff times, and a quick date scrubber. |
| 📊 **Standings** | All 12 group tables — points, goal difference, and recent form — **computed live** from finished results. |
| 🏆 **Knockout** | The complete bracket from Round of 32 to the Final, with placeholder slots (`2A`, `W73`…) until teams qualify. |
| 🔎 **Match detail** | Starting lineups, formations, a minute-by-minute event timeline, and match stats. |
| 🚩 **Real flags & teams** | Every one of the 48 nations, with official flags. |

Everything updates on a short polling loop, so live matches refresh on their own.

## 🛰️ Where the data comes from

The app talks **directly to FIFA's public API** (`api.fifa.com`) from the browser — CORS is open, so there's nothing to host and no token to manage.

| Data | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Matches (single source of truth) | `GET /api/v3/calendar/matches?idCompetition=17&idSeason=285023` |
| Match detail (lineups, formations) | `GET /api/v3/live/football/17/285023/{stage}/{match}` |
| Event timeline | `GET /api/v3/timelines/17/285023/{stage}/{match}` |
| Flags | `GET /api/v3/picture/flags-sq-4/{CODE}` |

> `17` = FIFA World Cup™ · `285023` = the 2026 edition.

**Standings are derived on the client** from the match feed (wins/draws/losses → points, goal difference, form), because FIFA only publishes the official standing table once the group stage completes. All the mapping lives in [`src/app/services/fifaData.ts`](src/app/services/fifaData.ts).

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
# install
npm install

# run the dev server  →  http://localhost:5173
npm run dev

# production build  →  dist/
npm run build
```

That's it. No `.env`, no keys, no services to spin up.

## 🗂️ Project structure

```

├── app/
│   ├── components/        # FixtureList, LeaderboardTable, KnockoutBracket, Flag …
│   ├── pages/             # MatchDetail, TeamProfile, PlayerCard, TopScorers
│   ├── services/

│   │   ├── useLiveData.ts # React hooks: useFixtures / useStandings / useKnockout / useMatchDetail
│   │   └── liveData.ts    # shared TypeScript types
│   └── routes.tsx
└── main.tsx
```

The data layer is fully decoupled: every screen consumes a hook that returns `{ data, loading, error }`, so the UI and the FIFA integration evolve independently.

### 📺 Optional: watch links

Map a match to a stream URL in [`public/watch-links.json`](public/watch-links.json) and a **Watch Live** button appears on live matches. Set `global` for a single fallback stream across all live games.

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- [ ] Wire Top Scorers, Team profile, and Player cards to live FIFA data (currently sample data)
- [ ] Route-level code splitting
- [ ] Tournament-finished / 404 states
